VirtualBox Cluster with Vagrant and Hadoop
=====================

Thanks to http://java.dzone.com/articles/setting-hadoop-virtual-cluster for getting me 99% of the way to it all working

- This utilizes the Vagrant 1.1 Api so you need to make sure you are on a new version of Vagrant
- Puppet 3.2.2 or greater is needed
  
  git@github.com:gizm0duck/vagrant-puppet-hadoop.git
  cd vagrant-puppet-hadoop
  vagrant up

That is all
